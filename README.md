# USIU-mapping
Using AI, the program can determine the shortest path between the different schools
We decided to use python programming language as the main language to demonstrate the working of our agent. Furthermore, we decided to resort to the use of a console to demonstrate output of the program. The first thing we did as a group was to create a PEAS documentation of our program. We came up with the following key points from our PEAS documentation.

1.	The performance measures would be the following;
a.	Distance of path chosen.
b.	Foot or car traffic on the path.
c.	Accessibility options.

2.	The environments were the following;
a.	USIU campus.
b.	USIU students, faculty and staff.
c.	Cars on campus.
d.	USIU campus buildings.
e.	Campus gardens.

3.	The sensors were the following;
a.	Location sensor.

4.	The actuators were the following;
a.	Speaker.
b.	Device screen.

From there we decided use the USIU map to create nodes and assign distances between the nodes. Nodes were the various buildings in USIU such as Lilian Beam. After the mapping out of the nodes we embarked on the implementation of the program. 
We used python programming language for the implementation. We began by declaring the graph as well as heuristics which we would use. The algorithm we chose was the A star algorithm hence need for heuristics. 
Furthermore, we made use of a menu so that it becomes user friendly when they want to make use of the program.
